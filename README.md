# EC601_hw2(1_a) Twitter API
demo1:
I create 3 part for 3 different functions.
First function is getting my Twitter Account info. This use function api.VerifyCredentials() to complete.

And second is submitting Twitter using API. In this function, I can submit or delete twitter in my PC terminal. 
It's really cool! I use function api.PostUpdate() to do that.

the finally function is to get other person's twitters. I type the special conditions for selecting twitter and 
then get the website link to get in. Even I can type location to filter twitter. I use api.GetSearch() to do.


# EC601_hw2(1_b) Google NLP API
demo2:
AutoML Natural Language uses machine learning to analyze the structure and meaning of documents. You train a custom machine learning model to classify documents, extract information, or understand the sentiment of authors.

A classification model analyzes a document and returns a list of content categories that apply to the text found in the document.

An entity extraction model inspects a document for known entities referenced in the document and labels those entities in the text.

A sentiment analysis model inspects a document and identifies the prevailing emotional opinion within it, especially to determine a writer's attitude as positive, negative, or neutral.


# For testing
we just need to use the funtion in another file to make sure our code is working in any coditions.
