I create 3 part for 3 different functions.
First function is getting my Twitter Account info. This use function api.VerifyCredentials() to complete.

And second is submitting Twitter using API. In this function, I can submit or delete twitter in my PC terminal. 
It's really cool! I use function api.PostUpdate() to do that.

the finally function is to get other person's twitters. I type the special conditions for selecting twitter and 
then get the website link to get in. Even I can type location to filter twitter. I use api.GetSearch() to do.
